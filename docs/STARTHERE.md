# Nokia Attestation Engine

This is the guide to running and using the engine. To start you have two optiosn

   * bare metal
   * docker compose

 I recommend docker compose for sanity reasons

## Quick Start Installation

To get started quickly on a bare-metal (ie: no docker etc) machine use the [Quick Start Installation](quickstart/installation.md) instructions.


### Libraries

Installing tpm2_tools and tpm2-pytss is a good idea ... for the latter pip3 needs to do quite a bit of building work so the following should sort out most problems

```bash
sudo apt install tpm2-tools libtss2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjson-c-dev libtss2-fapi1
sudo pip3 install tpm2-pytss
```


## Docker
The instructions for docker (and other container things) is here:

* [Docker](docker\dockercompose.md)
