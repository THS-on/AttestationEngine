* Attesting and managing devices remotely or on site. 
  *  **On-Site:** QR -codes containing device unique IDs can be placed on physical devices allowing for on site attestation and location fetching.
  *  **Remote:** Advanced device list filtering based on last attest result or device information.
* Map assistance for navigating between buildings using GPS.
* Global system overview

## Prerequisites

   * An attestation engine with [a10rest](../../a10rest) running
   * (optional) [Trust agent](../../t10) on each device for attesting the device

## (Optional) Configuration

There are no required configurations as the application will remember the list of attestation engines used in the past and will adhere to sensible defaults.
